# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
I will be analyzing the relationship between the type of city (rural, urban & suburban) and number of rides utilizing PyBer ride sharing services. Additionally, I will be calculating the percentage total fairs, rides and drivers by type of city. The goal of this analysis is to help the company improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability. 


## Analysis
To start the analysis, I combined large sets of city and ride data. Then, using Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook, I created charts to visualize the findings. All three charts below show a high volume of rides and drivers in urban cities, followed by suburban and then rural.
